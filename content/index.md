## Php Developer Resources For Markdown

###Overview
PHP Developers can add markdown to their applications by using a markdown parser, listed in the next section. Parsers are code, usually a class, that can parse content written in Markdown and return properly formatted Html. Once a parser is added to your Php application, converting content is as easy to do as calling the class method or function. For tutorials on how to add Markdown to your Php application see the tutorials section.
